# What is it?
[vim-heynumber][what-vim-heynumber] is a plugin for the Vim editor.
It enables `number` and `relativenumber` inside buffers where I really need it and switches
its behaviour in insert (nu/nornu) and normal (nu/rnu) modes.
Additionally it disables (nonu/nornu) linenumbers inside empty buffers and enables them dynamically
as soon as the buffer isn't empty anymore.

## Get it!
If you don't use a plugin manager, I recommend to use [vim-plug][getit-vimplug].
Else I'm pretty sure you know how your personal plugin management works. ;)

## Configuration
Currently neither configuration options are available nor are any additional configuration
steps to do. Simpy install the plugin and you should be good to go.
